# pandas-challenge
My analysis of the the PyCitySchool module is as follows:

Small to medium size schools had greater overall passing % vs large schools as seen in the data chart in output 360. The data demostartes that small and medium size schools had overall passing perecentages greater than large schools passing percentages. For example the data displays that small to medium size schools had an overall passing perecnt of 90 vs large schools that had an overall passing percentage of 58.

Taking a more in depth analysis of the data on why charter schools vs district schools perform better or worse, we see in output 186 and 185 that charter schools with math and reading scores greater than 70 were predominatley female students opposed to district schools that contained a mix of male and female students with scores higher than 70. Charter schools may be producing better overall grade scores based on the gender population, but data focused on the ratio between the number of male and female students at charter vs district schools is not presented in this data set.
